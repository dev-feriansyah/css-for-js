# CSS for JS Developer ~ Learning Progress

As a frontend engineer with experience in startup environments, I've gained a lot of valuable skills and insights. However, I've realized that leveling up involves more than just creating web applications that **look like design** and **function like users want**. It also means focusing on writing code that is:

- **Scalable**: Code that can grow and adapt as the project evolves without requiring significant rewrites.
- **Maintainable**: Code that is easy to understand, debug, and modify by yourself or other developers.
- **Reusable**: Code that can be reused across different parts of the project, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.
- **Performant**: Code that ensures the web application runs smoothly and efficiently, providing a good user experience.
- **Accessible**: Code that ensures the web application is usable by people with various disabilities, adhering to accessibility standards.
- **Consistent**: Code that follows a consistent style and structure, making it easier to collaborate and maintain over time.

Working on large projects in a startup environment often means that features need to be developed and scaled quickly. During this process, I recognized my need to improve in areas such as project management with good architecture, solving tricky UI issues, and ensuring accessibility.

This repository is part of my effort to level up as a frontend engineer. It contains my progress on learning from [CSS for JS by Josh]((https://css-for-js.dev/)), with the hope to:

- Increase UI problem solving skills
- Increase understanding how CSS work
- How expert manage their styles or css in small/big project
- Keep track of my learning progress
- Learn by practices
